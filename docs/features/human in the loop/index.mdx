# 🔐 What is Human-in-the-Loop?

Human-in-the-Loop is your safety net when using AI Tools. It puts YOU in control by asking for your permission before your AI can use any Tool — like searching the web, generating images, or running code.

Think of it as a "Are you sure?" button that protects you from unexpected AI actions.

---

## 🛡️ Why Do I Need This?

Here's why Human-in-the-Loop keeps you safe:

- 🚫 **Stop Risky Actions**: Prevent your AI from doing something you didn't expect
- 👀 **See What's Happening**: Know exactly what Tools your AI wants to use and how  
- 🎯 **Stay In Control**: You decide what happens, not the AI
- 📊 **Review Everything**: See all the data your AI wants to send to Tools

🛑 **Safety Tip**: Tools can search the internet, modify files, or send data to external services. Always review what your AI is trying to do!

---

## 🎮 How Does It Work?

When your AI wants to use a Tool, here's what happens:

1. 🤖 **AI Requests**: Your AI says "I want to use this Tool"
2. ⏸️ **Pause**: The AI stops and waits for you
3. 📋 **You Review**: A popup shows you exactly what the AI wants to do
4. ✅❌ **You Decide**: Click Allow, Allow Always, or Decline
5. 🚀 **Action**: The AI either uses the Tool or moves on

It's like having a co-pilot who asks before touching any buttons!

## ⚙️ How to Enable Human-in-the-Loop

Only administrators can turn this feature on for everyone:

### 🔧 Admin Setup
1. Go to **Admin Panel** ➡️ **Settings** ➡️ **General**
2. Find **"Global Tool Approval"** 
3. Toggle it **ON** ✅
4. Click **Save**

That's it! Now all users will see approval prompts when AI tries to use Tools.

💡 **Tip**: This setting affects your entire Open WebUI instance — all users and all chats will require approval.

---

## 🎯 Using the Approval Popup

When your AI wants to use a Tool, you'll see a popup with all the details:

### 📱 What You'll See
- 🔧 **Tool Name**: Which Tool your AI wants to use (like "Web Search" or "Image Generator")
- 📄 **Parameters**: Exactly what data the AI wants to send to the Tool
- ⚠️ **Review Reminder**: A note to check everything carefully

### 🎲 Your Options
You get three choices:

- 🟢 **Allow Once**: Let the AI use this Tool right now (just this time)
- 🟡 **Allow Always**: Use this Tool now AND automatically approve all future Tools in this chat
- 🔴 **Decline**: Stop the AI from using this Tool

### ✨ Smart Features
- 🔄 **Multiple Tools**: If your AI wants to use several Tools at once, you'll see them all
- 📱 **One Tab Only**: Only one browser tab shows the popup (prevents confusion)
- 🔔 **Status Updates**: Get notifications when Tools start running or get blocked

## 🤖 Auto-Approval for Trusted Chats

Found a chat you completely trust? You can skip approvals for that specific conversation:

### 🟡 How to Enable Auto-Approval
1. When you see an approval popup, click **"Allow Always"**
2. ✅ This approves the current Tools AND enables auto-approval for this chat
3. 🎉 Future Tools in this chat will run automatically

### 🔄 How to Disable Auto-Approval
You can turn off auto-approval anytime:
- 🟢 **Find the Badge**: Look for the green "Auto Tool Approval" badge with LED light in your chat bar
- ❌ **Click the X**: Click the X on the badge to disable auto-approval for this chat
- 🔴 **Manual Mode**: You'll now see approval popups again for new Tools

Auto-approval also automatically resets when:
- 🔄 The server restarts (for security)
- 🗑️ You delete the chat
- 💡 You start a new chat (each chat has its own setting)

💡 **Tip**: Use auto-approval only for chats where you completely trust what the AI is doing.

---

## 🚨 What to Watch Out For

### 🔍 Review These Carefully
- 🌐 **Web Requests**: Tools that search or fetch data from the internet
- 📁 **File Operations**: Tools that read, write, or modify files  
- 🖼️ **Image Generation**: Tools that create or process images
- 💾 **Code Execution**: Tools that run scripts or commands

### 🛑 Red Flags
Be extra careful if you see:
- 🔑 **Personal Information**: Your passwords, API keys, or sensitive data in parameters
- 🌍 **Unknown Websites**: URLs you don't recognize
- 📂 **System Paths**: File paths that look like system or configuration files
- 🚀 **Suspicious Commands**: Code that looks like it could harm your system

🚨 **When in Doubt, Decline**: It's always safer to say no and try again with a different approach.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🤔 Approval Popup Not Showing?
- ✅ Check that an admin enabled "Global Tool Approval" in settings
- 🔄 Refresh your browser page
- 🌐 Make sure you're viewing the chat where the AI is trying to use Tools

### 🔄 Auto-Approval Not Working?
- 📍 Auto-approval only works for the specific chat where you enabled it
- 🔗 Check that your browser connection is stable
- 🔄 Try refreshing the page to reset the connection

### 📱 Multiple Browser Tabs Acting Weird?
- 👁️ Only keep one tab open per chat for the best experience
- 🔄 Close extra tabs and refresh the remaining one
- 🎯 The system prevents conflicts, but one tab works best

---

## 🧠 Summary

Human-in-the-Loop gives you complete control over your AI's Tool usage:

- 🛡️ **Safety First**: Review every Tool before it runs
- 🎯 **You're in Control**: Approve, decline, or auto-approve as you see fit
